# Skailr intake (plain chat)

This project has **skailr-agents** installed. When the user does **not** invoke a slash command, classify the ask and route — do not freestyle application work outside these paths.

For detailed heuristics, follow skill `route-intake`.

## Hard rules

1. **Slash command wins.** If the user ran `/yolo`, `/patch`, `/map-repo`, `/discover`, `/ship-feature`, `/yolo-program`, `/continue-feature`, `/continue-program`, or any other skailr command — or is clearly continuing one — **do not re-triage**. Execute that command.
2. **Resume incomplete runs.** If `.claude/tmp/progress.md`, `.claude/program/ledger.md`, or `.claude/repo/progress.md` is incomplete and the user says continue/resume (or sends an empty follow-up after a killed run), route to `/continue-feature` / `/continue-program` / `/map-repo` (or re-enter `/yolo` / `/yolo-program` with no new prompt) as appropriate. Do not start a fresh `/patch`.
3. **Never write application code yourself** when routing to a build path — load and execute the matching command (or Task the named agents as that command specifies).

## Chooser (latest user ask)

| Ask looks like… | Route |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Question that falls in **exactly one** registered expert's band (`route-when` in `.claude/experts/registry.md`) | Task `expert` in **advise mode** — write `.claude/tmp/ask.md`; answer in chat, naming the expert. Guarded: 0 or 2+ matches fall through to the next row |
| Question / explain / where is / how does (**no** code change requested) | Task `researcher` in **ask mode** — write `.claude/tmp/ask.md`; answer in chat; do not start `/patch` or YOLO |
| Map / onboard / brownfield baseline / “audit this repo” (intent to baseline, not a one-off Q) | Execute `.claude/commands/map-repo.md` as `/map-repo` |
| Small / localized change (bug fix, typo, tweak, single surface) | Execute `.claude/commands/patch.md` as `/patch <ask>` |
| One cohesive feature (new capability, multi-file vertical slice, new ACs) | Execute `/yolo` |
| Whole app / MVP / many subsystems / unclear large scope | Execute `/yolo-program` |

Gated alternatives (`/ship-feature`, `/discover`…) exist when the user asks for gates explicitly; plain-chat auto-build uses YOLO paths only. `/map-repo` is the brownfield baseline path (confirm gate; no auto-build).

## Expert advisory routing (brief)

Some projects keep a small roster of minted domain experts under `.claude/experts/`. Routing reads **only** the Roster table in `.claude/experts/registry.md`; never open a profile to decide routing.

The expert row is **inert unless all four hold**. Otherwise fall through to the rows below:

1. No slash command is driving the turn (hard rule 1 still wins).
2. `.claude/experts/registry.md` exists with a non-empty roster. A missing registry means an empty roster, never an error.
3. The ask falls inside **exactly one** roster row's `route-when`. **Zero matches and two-or-more matches both mean "no expert route"** — this is the ambiguity guard, and guessing between two bands is worse than a generic answer.
4. That row's `maturity` is not `deprecated`.

When it fires, Task `expert` (the role name is always `expert`, never a slug) with:

```yaml
mode: advise
slug: <slug from the matched roster row>
question: <the user's ask, verbatim>
```

It loads only `.claude/experts/profiles/<slug>.md`, stays read-only, and writes `.claude/tmp/ask.md` in the same Question / Findings / Answer shape researcher ask mode uses, plus an `## Expert` block naming the slug and the sources it cited. Summarize the Answer in chat and say which expert answered.

If the expert returns `no-expert` (profile missing, unparseable, or deprecated), fall through to researcher ask mode. Never surface that as an error, and never mint an expert from plain chat.

## Ask-mode researcher (brief)

Task `researcher` with: read-only; answer *this* question; write `.claude/tmp/ask.md` (Question / Findings / Answer); summarize in the parent chat; do not invent a feature story or write `research.md` unless also in a feature pipeline.
